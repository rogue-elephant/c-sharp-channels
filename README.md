                            Add a migraine event
                            
                            Ability to add a migraine event that then shows up in the history list.
It should be possible to add this from the home screen and the list screen (or probably from ever screen really)

pressing the add button should show some sort of form that has a way to add the symptoms and pain areas from a drop down or checkbox (should be able to add more than one)

maybe show a toast notification or something when saving item

                            Ability to add lookups from within a complex JSON structure - for example if there are custom field definitions or enums specified in one place in the JSON and then the key for these referenced in later properties.

                            Ability to configure the conversion for schema files to output properties as markdown or markdown tables and to look up refs in other areas or files (this should work via the same mechanism as the lookups in task rogue-elephant/json-csv-tool#11 )
